                <p class="section-subtitle">The purpose of the Muslim Student Association at De Anza is to provide a safe and welcoming environment in which Muslim and Non-Muslim students can unite with one another to develop a sense of community and belonging. The De Anza MSA will work to provide resources to individuals seeking to learn more about Islam as a religion, spread awareness on issues faced by the greater Muslim Ummah, and more.</p>
                <p class="section-subtitle">Some past event examples are an Eid-Al-Adha event, a Ramadan Iftar, Palestine documentary screening, and a talk on the science of the Quran. This website provides an outline of the different components of the De Anza MSA. Feel free to contact the MSA through the discord server, instagram page, contacting any officers, or filling out the feedback form.</p>
